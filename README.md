# tornado_data
This Java program reads a file containing tornado data. It extracts the date of each tornado and calculates the day of the week it occurred. Then, it counts how many tornadoes happened on each day of the week. Finally, it prints out a table showing the count of tornadoes for each day of the week and identifies the day with the most tornadoes.
